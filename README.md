# Svelte Password Generator

This is a super simple password generator in svelte.  The are two required files because I haven't figured out how to make it a completely emcompased component like I would a react app. i.e. has the ability to just send in a specific icon.  Anyway, it works... 

To run:
```
npm run dev -- --open

```

I think the buttons are self explanatory, but just in case, the Copy button copies and the recycle button sends a different password.
